Idea
A person may be LIVING in a location other than the constituency where s/he is registered as a voter then s/he will be unable to cast his/her vote. To solve this problem we want to build an aplication in which the user if he/she knows well in advance that they will not be able to be in their constituency during voting period then they can apply to cast their vote from current constituency by notifying it on this app with their voter ID no.
Then the electoral committee will verify the data and after that if all's good then remove his name from voter list of their native constituency and add it to their current constituency.In this way their valuable vote don't get wasted.
Through Blockchain technology and Microsoft Azure, data can be shared in transparent and secured way. Using blockchain help to share data effectively to other end .
